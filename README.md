# CS 390R: Group H

## Target

Our target is GoldenEye 007 developed for the Nintendo 64.

From the [Wikipedia page on GoldenEye 007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(1997_video_game)):

> GoldenEye 007 is a 1997 first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. Based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, the player controls the secret agent James Bond to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon.

Like a lot of N64 games, 007 has gathered a large community of [speed runners](https://rankings.the-elite.net/goldeneye). With the goal of completing levels as fast as possible, speed runners will spend hours analyzing game behavior to find glitches to improve their time. Some communities will go as far as dumping ROMs and attempting to construct decompiled source code.

## Plan

Using [this decompilation project](https://github.com/n64decomp/007), and a "legally" obtained ROM, our group will attempt to find an arbitrary code execution exploit.

## Repository Structure

```
007/    -- Decompiled Source
```
