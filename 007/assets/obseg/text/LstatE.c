 "Following the Severnaya incident, MI6 has lost track of the Pirate helicopter. Presumably the bugging device has been located and destroyed.

 "The situation is critical, 007. Janus know we're on to them and they're taking control. We're going to circumvent the usual channels on this one. I've arranged contact with an ex-KGB agent, Valentin Zukovsky, in Statue Park, St. Petersburg. He claims he can set up a meeting with Janus. Apparently, the head of Janus wants to see you in person. Frankly, I'm uneasy about this but it's all we've got to go on.\n",

 "Valentin: Janus will meet you by Lenin's\n           statue. Beware him, he's a Lienz\n           Cossack traitor.\n",
 "Valentin: Now I must leave - the guards\n           are out in force and I fear they\n           may mistake me for a spy!\n",
